***Malarial cell claffication using a CNN from stratch.***

Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and other animals. Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases, it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death.
<br>
Malaria parasites can be identified by examining under the microscope a drop of the patient's blood, spread out as a “blood smear” on a microscope slide. Prior to examination, the specimen is stained (most often with the Giemsa stain) to give the parasites a distinctive appearance.

## A Pipeline of the model we have created:

**<h3>Firstly</h3>**
*Classes are easily imported without any hassles.*

They include:<pre>   
	- Load_Data<br>
	- PreProcessing<br>
	- Evaluations<br>
        - Statistical Analysis<br>
	- Real-Time Tracking of ML models and log retrival<br>
	- Custom Inference </pre>
<br><hr>
<!--
**<h3>Secondly</h3>**
The models include:

 <u>***Supervised Learning:***</u><br><pre>
	- Linear Regression<br>
	- Logistic Regression<br>
	- Naive Bayes<br>
	- Support Vector Machines<br>
	- Natural Language Processing</pre>
<br><br>
 <u>***Unsupervised Learning:***</u><br><pre>
	- KNN<br>
	- DBSCAN<br>
	- K-Means Cluster<br>
	- LDA<br>
	- NMF</pre>
<br><br>
 <u>***Tensorflow Neural Networks:***</u><br><pre>
	- ANN<br>
	- CNN<br>
	- Multi-Class Classification<br>
	- Sentiment Analysis<br>
	- Text Generation</pre>
-->
***Streamlit*** is used to include all the models in our web application to productionalize it.

<h3>Secondly</h3>
<u>Further, we have implemented the real-time tracking with the help of Google Firebase.</u>
The Firebase Realtime Database is a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that lets you store and sync data between your users in realtime.
Hence the data in fed from firebase in-real-time and it is visualized on the graphs.
<hr>
<h3>Finally</h3>
We come to the end of the project, where we have created a <b>'One Click EDA'</b>
<b>The EDA consists of :</b><br><pre>
	univariate graphical,<br> 
	multivariate graphical,<br> 
	univariate non-graphical,<br>
	and multivariate non-graphical</pre>

	but we have consolidated all the above into a single functionality.

## Installation and Quick Start
To use the repo with main app dashboard and run inferences, please follow the guidelines below:

- Clone the Repository: 

        $ git clone https://github.com/harshgeek4coder/Workspace_Labs.git
        
- Enter the directory: 

        $ cd Workspace_Labs
        
- Install the requirements:

        $ pip install -r requirements.txt

- For running on CLI - For the main Streamlit Dash Board, use the inference file as follows:

        $ streamlit run app.py

*With this, we hope you liked the project, if you did please make sure to leave a star, that will surely boost our morale! Thanks!*

NOTE : This project is made with the intention that an ordinary person can make sense out of, in other words, one who does not have any prior 
Machine Learning knowledge.
